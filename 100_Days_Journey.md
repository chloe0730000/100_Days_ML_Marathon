# 100 Days Note

* Day 1
  * Discovery journey
    * Find the problem -> prototype solution -> improve -> sharing -> practice -> participate competition
  
* Day2
  * Three types of ML
    * Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning
  
* Day3
  * ML Process	
    * Preprocessing: missing value, outlier, standardisation
    * Define goal: regression/classification problem, predictor and target value
    * Evaluation: regression -> RMSE, MAE, R-square; classification -> Accuracy, F1 score, AUC
    * Build and Tune Model

* Day4

  * Explore Data Analysis (EDA)

* Day5

  * Read and write file

  * `ndarray`, a fast and space-efficient multidimensional array providing vectorized arithmetic operations

* Day6
  * Data Preprocessing
  * Label Encoding vs One hot encode
  
* Day7

  * Variable types: numerical & categorical

* Day8

  * EDA
    * mean, median, mode
    * min, max, range, quartiles, variance, standard deviation

* Day9
  * Outlier
    * How to check?
      * check summary statistics (avg, sd, median, IQR)
      * plot: boxplot for univariate feature and scatterplot for multivariate
    * How to deal with outlier: replace with median/average, delete all columns, create new columns, etc
