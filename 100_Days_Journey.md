# 100 Days Note

* Day 1
  * Discovery journey
    * Find the problem -> prototype solution -> improve -> sharing -> practice -> participate competition
* Day2
  * Three types of ML
    * Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning
* Day3
  * ML Process	
    * Preprocessing: missing value, outlier, standardisation
    * Define goal: regression/classification problem, predictor and target value
    * Evaluation: regression -> RMSE, MAE, R-square; classification -> Accuracy, F1 score, AUC
    * Build and Tune Model

* Day4

  * Explore Data Analysis (EDA)
